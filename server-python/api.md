# API Endpoints

## Users
To access the users endpoint, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/users/.

Right now our GET requests show all the users in the DB. In the future, we should update this to show an individual user based on ID (likely through JWT)

To create a user, send a POST request with

DELETE and PUT requests require the id parameter in the body.
